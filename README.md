# Open Vantage React and Graphql assement

#### Goal
This assessment is to provide a candidate with the opportunity to show their skill in building with  React and a Graphql API.

## How do I get set up? ##

This assessment is for an intermediate to a senior level developer. The expectation is that the candidate shows technical knowledge to start a React project from scratch, review the requirements to find suitable packages/libraries and integrate with the provided API.

### Tasks ###
The API is modeled on a basic ordering system with two parts; 
1. Admin-side to create/update products, receive and manage orders
2. The client-side to view products and create orders.

The basic user stories would be as follow:

*As a client, I can view a list of products with detail information and images regarding the said product. I would like to make an order of items and view my orders.*

*As an admin of the system I can create products and input their details, I would need to put certain items in an inactive state which would not allow clients to order them.*

*As an admin of the site I can receive orders and update their status allowing the client feedback on their order.*

### Tools provided ###
The graphql endpoint is live:

  HTTP:  https://eu1.prisma.sh/frikan-erwee/ov-assesment-shop-prisma/dev
  WS:    wss://eu1.prisma.sh/frikan-erwee/ov-assesment-shop-prisma/dev

#### Minimal Requirements
**The following are constraints of the assessment:**
* A repo should be created with a basic readme to start/run the project.
* The client-side of the system should be least two pages.
* The admin-side of the system should be least two pages.
* A suitable routing library/package should be used.
* Updates on orders should be viewable live.

#### Additional Instructions ####

* Feel free to use any packages you require to complete the tasks.
* The styling is up to your discretion, due to time constraints UI libraries are welcomed.
* Remember it is not only completing the tasks but also a review of your coding style.
* Follow up questions may be asked regarding your code.
